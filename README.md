# What is Fusion Advance?

Fusion Advance is a custom build of Sonic Robo Blast 2, Version 2.1.25, forked from P-AS's [SRB2-Legacy build](https://github.com/P-AS/srb2-legacy), which is an attempt at an unofficial patch of Version 2.1, continuing where v2.1.25 left off. 
This build is maintained by members of the [Super SRB2 Games Z community](https://supersrb2gamesz.github.io/), (a.k.a, 98% chromaticpipe, lol) and adds a host of new features from versions before and after Version 2.1.

# What does this build have that makes it stand out?

* ## Classic OpenGL Lighting Features

  Originally introduced in Demo 4 in a broken state, and later removed after the Final Demo series of releases, OpenGL's old lighting features have returned!

  * ### Coronas
    These exist, although you need to disable the skybox for it to work. And they're really hard to capture. But I promise you, they exist.

* ## Uncapped Framerate

  A port of the Uncapped Framerate from Version 2.2/SRB2Kart! Now you can play at your monitor's refresh rate, making for an overall smoother experience!

* ## Orbital Camera

  This camera orbits around the player instead of panning, making looking around in third person way easier! Enable with the `cam_orbital` cvar in the console. (WARNING: Might look strange in software. OpenGL is preferred for this camera option.)

  (originally made by Sryder13 and Golden, with some additions backported from Version 2.2, original source [here.](https://github.com/GoldenTails/SRB2-2.1/tree/orbital-camera))

* ## SRB2Kart-Esque OpenGL Menu
 
  Now it doesn't suck!
